            Information systems and controls need to be tested frequently to ascertain their resilience against malicious
            attacks. When the need arises as it always does, we would be glad to avail you with our top notch, industry
            standard vulnerability assessment and penetration testing services.
          </p>

          <p class="mb-4" align="justify">
            Our methodologies are quite structured as they follow standardized processes and frameworks like Open Source
            Security Testing Methodology (OSSTMM), Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) project, Penetration
            Testing Execution Standard (PTES), and the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Technical
            guide to information security testing and assessment Special Publication 800-115. Following these
            methodologies coupled with our years of experience in conducting security assessments helps deliver value to
            our clients in testing their people, processes and technologies for defects and flaws.
          </p>

          <p class="mb-4" align="justify">
            We go beyond testing to proffer advisory on how to fix detected flaws and ensure that our simulated
            exploitation isn’t replicated in real life, and also advise on how to boost your enterprise security posture.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4" align="justify">
            Our approach to a vulnerability assessment and penetration test usually takes the steps below:
          <ul>
            <li>Documentation: Contract and agreement is signed along with other relevant documents.</li>
            <li>Scoping: We agree on what assets should be tested and what shouldn’t be tested explicitly. We also agree
              on what form the test should take e.g. white box, gray box, black box.</li>
            <li>Information gathering: We use open source intelligence and information given in the scope sheet to gain
              useful insight about assets in scope for testing.</li>
            <li>Vulnerability Assessment: We assess the in scope assets for vulnerabilities and take proper note of
              critical exploitable vulnerabilities that can be exploited by a real life attacker.</li>
            <li>Controlled Exploitation: We exploit the confirmed vulnerabilities using the exact same tools a real life
              hacker would. However, proper care is taken to not interrupt business processes.</li>
            <li>Reporting: We produce reports on the exercise detailing what was exploited, how it was exploited and how
              to fix the exploited flaw.</li>
          </ul>
