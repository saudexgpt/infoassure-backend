            Cyber incidences are on the increase and the menace of cybercrime is the new reality for businesses globally
            as the threat landscape changes constantly. Corporations and business owners now have the understanding that
            it is not a matter of if you are vulnerable or if will be targeted, but a matter of when. As a result, it has
            become pertinent that security is engineered into applications, networks and IT environments for organizations
            to stand a chance of withstanding breaches, mitigating compromises and preventing service disruptions that can
            be costly to the growth and future of their organization.

            A network firewall is a fundamental component of a network security infrastructure that acts as a barrier
            between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks, such as the Internet. Its primary function
            is to monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules and
            policies. By enforcing these rules, a network firewall helps protect an organization's network and data from
            unauthorized access, cyber threats, and potential security breaches.
          </p>

          <p class="mb-4" align="justify">
            Network firewalls are essential security devices that help protect organizations' networks from cyber threats
            and unauthorized access. They provide an important defense against potential security breaches and play a
            crucial role in network security strategy and risk mitigation.

            A Web Application Firewall (WAF) is a cyber-security solution designed to protect web applications from a wide
            range of online threats and attacks. Unlike traditional network firewalls that focus on network traffic, WAF
            specifically targets the application layer of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model. It sits between
            users and the web application server, filtering and monitoring HTTP and HTTPS requests and responses.

            play a crucial role in safeguarding sensitive data, maintaining application availability, and ensuring the

            Securing Incident and Event Management (SIEM) is a critical process in cyber-security that involves securing
            the tools, infrastructure, and processes used for collecting, analyzing, and responding to security incidents
            and events. SIEM is essential for detecting and mitigating potential cyber-security threats and attacks,

            File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) is a cyber-security process that involves monitoring and detecting
            unauthorized or unexpected changes to files and file systems on a computer system or network. FIM is crucial
            for maintaining the integrity and security of critical files, configuration files, system files, and
            application files. It helps organizations detect potential security breaches, malware infections, and
            unauthorized modifications to critical files.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4" align="justify">

            This solution (FIM) is a vital cyber-security practice that helps organizations detect unauthorized changes
            and maintain the integrity of critical files and systems. By continuously monitoring and analyzing file
            changes, FIM enables early threat detection, enhanced security, and compliance with industry standards and
            regulations.

            Multi-factor authentication (MFA), also known as two-factor authentication (2FA), is a security process that
            requires users to provide two or more forms of identification or credentials to verify their identity before
            gaining access to a system, application, or online account. MFA is an essential security measure that adds an
            extra layer of protection beyond the traditional username and password authentication. It helps mitigate the
            risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and identity theft.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4" align="justify">

            By implication, Multi-factor Authentication (2FA) is a critical security measure that significantly
            strengthens user authentication by requiring multiple credentials to verify identity. By using a combination
            of factors, MFA helps protect against unauthorized access and data breaches, making it an essential component
            of a robust cyber-security strategy.

            Database Activity Monitoring (DAM) is a cyber-security technology that provides real-time monitoring,
            auditing, and analysis of database activities and events. DAM solutions are designed to track and record all
            database transactions and access attempts, allowing organizations to detect and respond to suspicious or
            unauthorized activities quickly. The primary goal of DAM is to enhance the security and compliance of
            databases by providing visibility into user activities and protecting sensitive data from potential breaches.
